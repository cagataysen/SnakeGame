# SnakeGame
 
I simply tried to make a snake game with basically Turtle Library which is a popular way for introducing programming to kids. 

Firstly setting up the screen was a big element. Because I implemented other things visually on that screen and in this way we can run and try what we have done so far... Then to create the snake, we must firstly implement its head. Secondly, we should implement a food that snake will eat and it will grow up after eating that food. 

Other elements in the code are briefly math for some game rules. For instance, if snake bites its body part, game will stop. 

We can organize keyboard bindings with onkeypress and easily play with any preferable.
